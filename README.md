# CryptoVerse App
This application was created using React.js, Ant Design for the UI, the react Chart.js library for the charts and the Coinranking APi from RapidAPI.

It allows you to check general crypto statistics like the total number of cryptocurrencies, total exchanges, total 24hr volume etc.
It also gives you access to the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and you click on each to give you further information on that crypto.
And then finally there's a section for crypto news that can be fltered to give news specific to each cryptocurrency.
